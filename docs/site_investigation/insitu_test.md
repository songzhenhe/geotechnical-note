# Insitu Test



## SPT

E = 1 to 1.5 N for residual soil

su ~= 5N

Stroud (1974, 1989) recommended that E be estimated as 

Su = (4.5 - 5.5) N 


Eu = 50 to 1,500 Cu ; use 200 for typical soil

## Shear Vane


Probedrill uses the GeoMil FFL 100 Vane Shear which comes with three rectangular vane types.  These are:

* 70mm x 35mm;
* 100mm x 50mm; and
* 150mm x 75mm vanes.

The test starts by pushing the vane and the rod vertically into the soft soil. 
The vane is then rotated at a speed which can be adjusted from 0.1° per second up to 15° per second, while the sampling rate can be user defined.

Upon completion of the undrained shear test, the user can easily start a remould test. The vane will be turned 5 revolutions at a speed of 15° per second. 
To prevent damage the maximum torsion during remould is limited to 50%. After the 5 revolutions the system returns to the preset turning speed and will log
 the residual shear strength.
