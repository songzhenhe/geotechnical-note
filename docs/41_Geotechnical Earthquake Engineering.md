## Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering





## Seismic Hazard Assessment 

The methodology used for the probabilistic analysis is based on the methods by Cornell (1968, Ref. 6). The likelihood of occurrence of earthquakes within defined seismic source zones can be determined by examining seismicity data. Using historical earthquake records for the region, magnitude-frequency recurrence relationships can be established for potential earthquake source zones. The magnitude recurrence relationships are of the form derived by Gutenberg-Richter (1944, Ref. 7):

log(N) = a – b(M)

where, M = Earthquake magnitude
N = Annual frequency of occurrence for earthquakes exceeding magnitude M (1/N = Return Period)
The parameter “a” is dependent on the period of observation and the level of seismicity, whilst the parameter “b” is a measure of seismicity that describes the scaling relationship between the number of small and large earthquakes.
