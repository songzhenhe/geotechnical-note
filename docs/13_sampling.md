# Sampling




## block sample

* Cutting a ~ 200mm cubic undisturbed sample from a test pit.
* Wax the sample surfaces
* Wrap the sample with cling film or foil and Place the wrapped sample into a 200mm cubic box and fill the voids with silt/fine sand
* Place the 200mm box into a 300mm box and fill the gaps between the two boxes with paper strips or plastic chips
* Place cushion (usually scrambled paper or sponge) on the base of a 300 mm x 300 mm x 300 mm box, then put the 200 mm sample box into 
the 300 mm box and fill the void with scrambled papers, sponge or bubble plastic sheets to ensure that the 200 mm box is firmly secured 
in the 300 mm box (Plate 4). The 300 mm box shall be adequately reinforced to take the possible impact during transportation.
